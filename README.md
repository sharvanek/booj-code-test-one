# Booj Code Test

## 1. Equilibrium Indexes.

#### What is an equilibrium index?
An equilibrium index of a sequence is an index into the sequence such that the sum of elements at lower indices is equal to the sum of elements at higher indices.

#### Task
Write a function that, given a sequence, returns its equilibrium indices (if any). Assume that the sequence may be very long. Feel free to Google for hints, but give lots of comments about what your thoughts are and your process for devising an algorithm.

#### Running the Test
```
python EquilibriumIndexTest.py
```

## 2. TrueBooj
#### Task
Write a program that when given a range of numbers (for this test 1 to 75) that returns every number in the range. Keep in mind the following exceptions: 
* For multiples of 3, print "**True**".
* For multiples of 5, print "**Booj**".
* For multiples of 10, print "**TrueBooj**".

#### Running the Test
```
python TrueBoojTest.py
```
